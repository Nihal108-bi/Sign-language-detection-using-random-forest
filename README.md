# MudraVani - AI-Powered Indian Sign Language Recognition

MudraVani is an AI-driven system designed to **recognize and interpret Indian Sign Language (ISL)** using computer vision and machine learning. The project aims to bridge the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community and the general population by providing **real-time hand gesture recognition** and **text-to-speech conversion** for seamless interaction.

## 🚀 Features

✔ **Real-Time Sign Recognition** – Uses AI to detect and interpret ISL signs instantly.
✔ **Alphabet Recognition** – Accurately identifies individual letters in ISL.
✔ **Word Formation Capability** – Converts sequences of gestures into meaningful words and sentences.
✔ **Sign-to-Speech Conversion** – Converts recognized gestures into audible speech output.
✔ **Interactive UI** – A clean, user-friendly React frontend for easy interaction.
✔ **Lightweight & Fast** – Optimized model for smooth performance on various devices.
✔ **Accessible to All** – Aimed at breaking communication barriers between the DHH community and the hearing world.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

🔹 **Frontend**: React.js (for interactive UI)  
🔹 **Backend**: Python  
🔹 **Machine Learning**: MediaPipe, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
🔹 **Database**: MongoDB (Optional)  

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ **Hand Gesture Detection**: The system captures hand movements via a webcam.  
2️⃣ **Feature Extraction**: Keypoints from hand gestures are extracted using MediaPipe.  
3️⃣ **Model Prediction**: The trained ML model predicts the corresponding alphabet or sign.  
4️⃣ **Sentence Formation**: The system intelligently groups letters into words.  
5️⃣ **Speech Conversion (Optional)**: Converts recognized text into speech for better accessibility.
